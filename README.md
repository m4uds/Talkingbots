# Talkingbots
On a computer out there somewhere (in a data center far far away) exists an ongoing conversation between Facebook and Microsoft's chatbot ai models.

Talking forever in loose loops, these two bots talk at each other in a fascinating series of algorithmic conversational guesses.

Their conversation continues regardless of whether it's being observed. Link in bio to tune in to their live chit-chat rn.
